# AirPower-Game
Description of the Game

AirPower is a multiplayer gamer where you and a teammate each control a ship. Both ships are restricted to the left side of the screen.
The object of the game is to shoot and destroy the enemy hangar located on the right hand side of the screen.
This is the only way to win.
But watch out! As you are shooting at the enemy hangar, enemy turrets will be shooting at your home hangar and at your ships.
Should both of your ships lose all of their health or the home hangar loses all of its health, you lose.
With this, it may be wise to shoot and destroy the enemy turrets before you shoot the enemy hangar.
One last thing, if you ship is down to 1 health, go and run into one of the blue powerups on your island and your health will regenerate.
However, if you try and collect the powerup when you have more than one health, it will dissapear and do nothing!
For reference, both ship's health, the home hangar health, and the enemy hangar health are located at the bottom of the screen.
Once you can beat the game, it is fun to see how little time is takes you. There is a clock located in the top left for refrence,
and once you win or lose a new screen will tell you what you final time was.
Good Luck! #airpower
